URL Shortner

Server used: 000webhost free hosting.
Technologies used: JS, HTML, FETCH API, Firebase Realtime datastore, MD5 hashing, Randome number generator

Firebase realtime datastore is used to store JSON objects in the form:
	973738
	-N4xn5DVLo4svnTkBFnd:"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_properties.asp"

	973738: hash created programatically for the original URL. This is by using MD5 to hash Date.now() and randomly choose 5 characters from the generated hash.
	-N4xn5DVLo4svnTkBFnd : This is autogenerated key by firebase
	"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_properties.asp": Value/ original URL which the page should redirect to.

User can shorten new URL's from http://irelandmalayalikal.ie/add.html. Current unix timestamp will be MD5 hashed and 5 chars chosen randomly from the hash. This hash is the key of the JSON object. Value is another JSON object with an autogenerated key and original URL being the value. This is added to realtime datastore by calling firebase REST API POST. Raw data (input) is added as JSON request body. User get shortened URL as an alert on the page.

UPDATE:
To ensure no conflicts occur, the hashing process can be changed to hash a substring of the URL after adding a salt to the substring. Salt can be taken from a dictionary.  

When a user enter the shortned URL for eg: http://www.irelandmalayalikal.ie/973738, program fetches realtime datastore for the json object with key 973738 and retrieve the value json object. It then parses the json to get the value which is equal to the original URL and then user get redirected to the original page they are looking for.
